## Summary
Code and projects for course I teach at local liesure center.

## Target group
All students in course are 12-15 years old and most of them had no expirience with programing when we started. So do not expect anything complicated

`apps` is a folder with sipmple applications. We aim to learn enough about programming, that we will be able to create these apps.

`code_from_lessons` is a folder with code we made each lesson. This is also provided to all students.
